# Perceptron Algorithm for recognizing handwritten digits
A Perceptron is an algorithm used for supervised learning of binary classifiers. Binary classifiers decide whether an input, usually represented by a series of vectors, belongs to a specific class.
Implementation:
- We take all the input values and multiplying them by their weights. 
- All of these multiplied values are added together to create the weighted sum. 
- The weighted sum is then applied to an activation function, producing the perceptron's output.
- The activation function maps the output value to a certain range.
- A total of 10 Perceptrons are used for this implementation.
